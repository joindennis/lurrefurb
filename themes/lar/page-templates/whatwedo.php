		<div class="divider" style="width: 560px;"></div> 

<p>Early in the business we recognized that the design side of the Condominium Refurbishment industry needed to be matched by strong Project Management and construction execution skills and experience.  We set our sights on providing unrivaled customer service and quality in our workmanship. We strive to be consistent, take responsibility, move forward and innovate. Most importantly we have learned that great interiors are about emotional connections and successful projects are about the integration of the right people into the right places.</p>
<p>We partner with only ARIDO accredited Design Firms that understand, respect and reflect the distinct social, cultural, and architectural traditions of the communities we work with to create design solutions that are individually tailored to suit the specific criteria for each project. We take care of the rest…</p>

   <li class='active has-sub'><a href='#'><span><b class="super_bold">S</b>elect a project manager</span></a>
      <ul>
    This may be the most important distinguishing element in LAR's process. 
Based on your needs, we select the right project manager who is dedicated to you. 
He or she assumes the responsibility to drive the project through its various stages and to keep you 
fully informed along the way.
      </ul>
   </li>
   
   
      <li class='active has-sub'><a href='#'><span><b class="super_bold">o</b>bjective refinement</span></a>
      <ul>
    We will have discussed your objectives early in our engagement. However, our experience has proven

that changes in thinking or in goals often occur early in the process. Therefore, a detailed review of your 

goals with a project manager often clarifies and reveals these modifications. They are often small, but 

by ensuring these subtleties are captured, we ensure you are thrilled with the result.
      </ul>
   </li>
   
   
         <li class='active has-sub'><a href='#'><span><b class="super_bold">S</b>chedule the phases</span></a>
      <ul>
   The project manager will then create a project plan with milestones that will be shared with you. This

allows you to know how the project is progressing at all times. The project plan will be presented to you 

in draft so that you can provide your input before we begin. This upfront planning will prove to be cost 

effective as well as timely.
      </ul>
   </li>
   
   
      
         <li class='active has-sub'><a href='#'><span><b class="super_bold">i</b>dentify the design team</span></a>
      <ul>
   Different designers have different approaches and different aesthetic preferences. Knowing this, we 

have cultivated relationships with several top design teams. We will recommend the team that fits your 

objectives, timelines, and budgets, for your approval.
      </ul>
   </li>
   
            <li class='active has-sub'><a href='#'><span><b class="super_bold">m</b>anage the design process</span></a>
      <ul>
   In our experience, management of the creative process is critical to meeting budgets, timelines and the 

desired outcomes from a project. With over 25 years of experience in managing and containing the 

design process, what can otherwise be a freewheeling creative phase is simplified and we continually 

keep you informed as this phase progresses.
      </ul>
   </li>
   
 
             <li class='active has-sub'><a href='#'><span><b class="super_bold">p</b>resent concepts, budget & tender</span></a>
      <ul>
   We understand that in a significant overhaul to the aesthetic of a building, or a part of one, Residents 

and Board members require and deserve a voice. We take your valuable input into consideration and 

incorporate it into the conceptualized design that best suits your vision and budget. Co ordinate with 

the Design Team Tender documents for competitive bids and deliver to the Corporation.
      </ul>
   </li>
 
              <li class='active has-sub'><a href='#'><span><b class="super_bold">l</b>aunch construction</span></a>
      <ul>
   This in itself involves multiple steps including scheduling and managing the trades, who are skilled not 

only in their specialty but also in making the residents experience during construction as painless as 

possible. It also involves ordering materials, preparing the building physically and communicating with 

residents so they know what to expect. All of this is expertly addressed by your project manager. You 

will be continuously updated so there are no surprises.
      </ul>
   </li>
 
 
 
 
            <li class='active has-sub'><a href='#'><span><b class="super_bold">e</b>xecute the implementation plan</span></a>
      <ul>
 The final step is the execution of all elements of the project. Once again this will be clearly

communicated to the residents. For instance, on a corridor refurbishment, the plan will identify the 

floor by floor schedule including times of work minimizing the impact to the Residents daily lives. 

This thorough attention to detail is implemented throughout all phases of the project until your final 

assessment.
